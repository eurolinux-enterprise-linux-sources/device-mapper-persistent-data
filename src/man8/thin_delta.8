.TH THIN_DELTA 8 "Thin Provisioning Tools" "Red Hat, Inc." \" -*- nroff -*-
.SH NAME
thin_delta \- Print the differences in the mappings between two thin devices.

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B thin_delta
.RB [ options ]
.I {device|file}

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B thin_delta
allows you to compare the mappings in two thin volumes (snapshots allow common blocks between thin volumes).

This tool cannot be run on live metadata unless the \fB\-\-metadata\-snap\fP option is used.

.SH OPTIONS
.IP "\fB\-\-thin1, \-\-snap1\fP"
The numeric identifier for the first thin volume to diff.

.IP "\fB\-\-thin1, \-\-snap1\fP"
The numeric identifier for the second thin volume to diff.

.IP "\fB\-m, \-\-metadata\-snap\fP [block#]"

If you want to get information out of a live pool then you will need
to take a metadata snapshot and use this switch.  In order for the
information to be meaningful you need to ensure the thin volumes
you're examining are not changing (eg, do not activate those thins).

.IP "\fB\-\-verbose"
Provide extra information on the mappings.

.IP "\fB\-h, \-\-help\fP"
Print help and exit.

.IP "\fB\-V, \-\-version\fP"
Output version information and exit.
