v0.6.2
======

- Fix bug in thin_delta
- Fix recent regression in thin_repair.
- Force g++-98 dialect
- Fix bug in thin_trim

v0.6.1
======

Fix bug in thin_dump when using metadata snaps.

v0.6.0
======

thin_ls

v0.5.6
======

era_invalidate may be run on live metadata if the --metadata-snap option is given.

v0.5.5
======

You may now give the --metadata_snap option to thin_delta without specifying where the snap is.

Update man pages to make it clearer that most tools shouldn't be run on live metadata.

Fix some bugs in the metadata reference counting for thin_check.

v0.5.1
======

Fix bug where the tools would crash if given a very large metadata
device to restore to.

v0.5
====

- thin_delta, thin_trim
- --clear-needs-check flag for cache_check
- space map checking for thin check

v0.4
====

- All tools switch to using libaio.  This gives a large performance
  boost, especially to the write focused tools like thin_restore.

- Added a progress monitor to thin_restore, cache_restore and era_restore

- Added a --quiet/-q option to *_restore to turn off the progress bar

- Removed variable hint size support from cache tools.  The kernel
  still only supports a fixed 32bit width.  This will have a side
  effect of reducing the executable sizes due to less template
  instatiation.

- Tools rolled into a single executable to save space.

- Fixed some bugs when walking bitsets (possibly effecting cache_dump
  and cache_check).
